# Feature Proposal: Aura Flames 2.0 - The Cosmic Expansion

To make Aura Flames even more fun and engaging, here are several proposed features inspired by modern gamification and AI trends:

## 1. 🌌 AI Cosmic Insight (Gemini Powered)
Instead of static quotes, we can integrate the Gemini API to generate personalized "Celestial Readings".
- **Dynamic Content**: Every result gets a unique, witty, or poetic description.
- **Cheeky Tone**: The AI can be a bit playful or mysterious depending on the result.

## 2. ✨ Star-Tapping Mini-Game (Loading Phase)
Make the 2.5s "Consulting the Stars" screen interactive.
- **Interactive Particles**: Allow users to tap the falling star particles.
- **Luck Meter**: Tapping stars fills a meter. A full meter adds a "Golden Aura" effect to the final result card.

## 3. ♈ Zodiac Resonance
Add an optional birth month selector for both names.
- **Synergy Score**: Show a "Zodiac Match" percentage based on astrological compatibility.
- **Themed Icons**: Display the zodiac signs with glowing neon icons on the result card.

## 4. 🖼️ Unlockable Art Themes
Encourage re-use by letting users unlock new aesthetic themes for their results.
- **Themes**: Cyberpunk, Classic Anime, Synthwave, or Minimalist Mono.
- **Unlock Criteria**: Check 5 connections, share a result, or get a 'Marriage' result.

## 5. 🔮 Destiny Snapshot (5-Year Prediction)
A fun, AI-generated "future glimpse" displayed at the bottom of the card.
- **Example**: *"In 2031, you two will be co-founding a Martian cafe."*

## 6. 🎵 Ambient Cosmic Audio
Add a layers of immersive sound:
- **Background**: Soft, lo-fi cosmic ambient music.
- **SFX**: Subtle "sparkle" sounds when results appear or stars are tapped.
